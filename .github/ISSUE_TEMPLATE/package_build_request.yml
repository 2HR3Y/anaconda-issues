        Please use this form to submit a request for a package to be built.

        We kindly ask that you take the time to:
          - Search our defaults channels to verify whether the package already exists:
            - For Python packages: https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/
            - For R packages: https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/
          - Search through [existing issues](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues) to verify whether someone else has already requested the same package.
          - Fill in all of the fields below, as best you can.
          - Review and comply with our [Anaconda Community Code of Conduct](https://www.anaconda.com/community-code-of-conduct/).

        Thank you for your contribution and for helping Anaconda better serve its community of users. üêç
